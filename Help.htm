<p><a NAME="Encrypting"></a><font size="-1">Encrypting a file</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">The program is simple to use. Click on the &quot;Browse&quot; button to
find a file you would like to encrypt. When found, it will show up in the bigger window
for you to review and see if it's the right file. If so, click on &quot;Encipher&quot; and
a password box will show up. In order to prevent misspellings in the password, it must be
entered twice. No-one can see the password you type, thus ensuring privacy. Depending on
the length of the file chosen and your system speed, a file can be encrypted from 1/100 of
a second up to 10 seconds. The encrypted file is then shown again to let you see the
results. There is no need to save the encrypted file as it automatically saves itself and
deletes the original file. No need to panic, as will be shown in the next paragraph.</font>

<p><a NAME="Deciphering"></a><font size="-1">Deciphering a file</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">If you are given an encrypted file, you will need to know the password
to decipher it. Remember, the program's passwords are case sensitive. That means, if the
password is An9uUiop234, then it must be An9uUiop234. It cannot be an9uuiop234, or the
deciphering will not work. After the correct password is entered, the file will be
deciphered and brought back into the window for you to read.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">&lt;&lt;&lt;----------&gt;&gt;&gt;</font> </p>

<p><a href="#Top">To the top</a> </p>

<p><a NAME="Password"></a><font size="-1">About the password</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">This is the most important part of the program. Passwords given can be
of any length, use any character the keyboard makes (even foreign letters such as é, ß,
ü, etc.). You can make an entire sentence if you want (considering you'll remember it
later). It can be a mix of numbers and letters. If you can type it, it can be a password
in this program.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">The password can be of any length up to 255 characters long. Remember,
it is case sensitive, therefore if there are any capital letters, they must be used in the
password to decipher the file. It is advisable to use passwords that are more than 6
characters long, and make sure the person you are sending the file to knows the password
for decipherment. Also, use different passwords for each file you encrypt, don't use the
same one over and over again.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">You can use all alphabetic characters, all numeric or a combination of
both. Spaces and other signs and symbols can be used, therefore making a password an
entire sentence if you'd like (providing you can remember it later).</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">The password is stored in the program's executable file, thus keeping
it safe and away from plain view.</font> <br>
&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; <a href="#Top">To the top</a> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<p><a NAME="Dont"></a><font size="-1">DO NOT:</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">1) DO NOT give your password to anyone that is not to read the
information that has been encrypted.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">2) DO NOT use common passwords that others might know (e.g. birthdays,
maiden names, company names, Social Security Numbers, etc.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">3) DO NOT use a single letter as a password.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">4) DO NOT use the same password for a different file.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">5) DO NOT forget your password.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">Passwords are case sensitive. That means, if the password is &quot;The
QUicK BroWN f67ox&quot;, then you must type in &quot;The QUicK BroWN f67ox&quot;. Just
typing &quot;the quick brown f67ox&quot; will not work and the program will not let you
see the information. Therefore, the password you type or the password you give out MUST BE
TYPED EXACTLY THE SAME WAY.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">For each file, DO NOT use the same password. For example, you encrypt
five files, use five different passwords. This will keep things more secure.</font> </p>

<p><a NAME="What"></a><font size="-1">What files can be encrypted?</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">Almost any file that you have on your computer can be encrypted. That
includes: Text files (from any word processing application like Microsoft Notepad or MS
Word, Corel Word Perfect, Lotus, etc.), any image file (BMP, GIF, JPG, TIFF, WMF, PNP,
etc), Spreadsheets (Excel, Fox Pro, Access, etc.)It is not recommended to encrypt system
files (Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) for example) as you can make the entire computer
temporarily unusable. Entire programs can be crippled by encrypting the &quot;.EXE&quot;
file, but caution should be used when doing this also.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">As mentioned above, this program was written with the business person
in mind. It can, however, be used by private people to keep their files safe from
intruding eyes. It is legal to send overseas, thus making international business files
safe from the competition.</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">&lt;&lt;&lt;----------&gt;&gt;&gt;</font> </p>

<p><a href="#Top">To the top</a> </p>

<p><a NAME="How"></a><font size="-1">HOW SAFE IS THIS PROGRAM?</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">An encrypted message was given to 10 people from computer hackers to
software analysts and computer programmers. Of those 10, a software analyst cracked the
code in two weeks. The others haven't been able to as of this writing (after three
months).</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">To ensure even better safety, when a file is encrypted, the following
header is seen at the top of the encrypted message:</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">[Secret]0hDeg48SS</font> </p>

<p><font size="-1">Take this out of the message (DO NOT permanently delete it!!) before
e-mailing it, and send this header under a seperate e-mail, this is what the program needs
to decipher the file. Getting the password to the recipient can be done through your own
means (sent in a letter, over the phone or as a word/sentence in the middle of the e-mail
message)</font> </p>

any problems you may have after installation. I am not responsible for forgotten
